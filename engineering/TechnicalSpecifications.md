## 5.2 System Architecture

### Detailed Description of the System's High-Level Architecture

The system architecture of your application comprises several main components that work together to ensure the functionality and performance of the system. These components are divided into backend and frontend elements, connected through various interfaces and protocols.

### Main Components and Their Interactions

1. **Backend**:
   - **Go**: The primary programming language for backend logic. Go was chosen for its high performance and scalability. It is a compiled language that supports efficient parallel processing.
   - **PostgreSQL**: A relational database used to store persistent data. PostgreSQL provides stable and extensible SQL support, enabling complex queries and transactions.
   - **Redis**: An in-memory database used for fast caching and quick data access. Redis helps improve system response times by keeping frequently used data in memory.

2. **Frontend**:
   - **Quasar Framework**: A framework for developing high-quality Single-Page Applications (SPAs), Server-Side Rendering (SSR), and Progressive Web Apps (PWAs) from a single codebase.
   - **Pinia**: A lightweight and modular state management tool for Vue.js, facilitating the management of application state.
   - **Chart.js**: A library for interactive and appealing charts, used to visualize data on the user interface.
   - **QCalendar**: A calendar library optimized for integration with the Quasar framework, providing calendar functionalities.

3. **Libraries and Tools**:
   - **Dotenv**: For managing environment variables, keeping configuration data secure and separate from the code.
   - **Lodash**: A utility library for handling and manipulating arrays, objects, and other data types.
   - **Snyk**: A tool for security and vulnerability management, helping identify and fix potential security issues in the code.
   - **Swagger**: A suite of open-source tools for API documentation and testing, ensuring clear and understandable API documentation.

4. **Interactions and Data Flow**:
   - **HTTP/HTTPS**: Communication between the frontend and backend occurs over HTTP/HTTPS protocols. RESTful APIs are used to send requests from the frontend to the backend and return responses.
   - **Websockets**: For real-time communication between client and server, e.g., for real-time notifications or live data updates.
   - **Database Queries**: Backend services interact with PostgreSQL and Redis using SQL queries and Redis commands to store and retrieve data.
   - **Caching**: Redis is used to cache frequently accessed data, significantly improving system performance.
