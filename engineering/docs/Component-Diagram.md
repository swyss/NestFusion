### Frontend Components
- **Application Management**
  - **Settings Manager**: Manages application settings.
  - **Config Manager**: Manages application configuration.
- **Log Management**
  - **Log Overview**: Provides an overview of log data.
  - **Log Editor**: Allows editing of log data.
  - **Log Details**: Shows detailed log data.
- **User Management**
  - **User Overview**: Overview of user data.
  - **User Editor**: Edits user information.
  - **User Registration**: Handles user registration process.
  - **User Login**: Manages user login process.
  - **Activity Log**: Tracks user activities.
- **Module Management**
  - **Module Settings**: Manages settings for various modules.
  - **Module A Manager**: Handles operations related to Module A.
  - **Module B Manager**: Handles operations related to Module B.

### Backend Components
- **API Gateway**: Interface for communication with the frontend.
- **Controller Layer**: Controls the data flow between the service and repository layers.
- **Business Logic Layer**: Contains business logic and processes data.
- **Data Access Layer**: Provides access to data stored in databases.
- **Data Models**: Defines the structure of data.
- **Environment Config**: Manages environment-specific configurations.

### Databases
- **Relational DB**: Stores relational data such as user information and transactions (PostgreSQL).
- **Log DB**: Stores time-series data such as logs (InfluxDB).

## Data Flow and Interactions
- **Frontend to Backend**: The frontend communicates with the backend via the API Gateway.
- **Backend to Databases**: The backend interacts with the Relational DB and Log DB to store and retrieve data.
- **Log Management**: The Log Management module in the frontend displays log data retrieved from the Log DB.

## Security Measures
- **Authentication and Authorization**: All interactions between the frontend and backend are secured by authentication and authorization mechanisms. This includes verifying user login credentials and ensuring that only authorized users have access to specific resources.
