## Entity-Relationship Diagram
For more details on technical specifications and system design, refer to the following documents:
- [Technical Specifications](../TechnicalSpecifications.md)
- [System Design](SystemDesign.md)

The ER diagram represents the relationships between different entities in the system. Key entities include:

#### User Entities
- **User**: Represents the user of the system.
- **UserPassword**: Stores user passwords securely.
- **UserLog**: Logs user activities.
- **UserSetting**: Stores user-specific settings.
- **UserRole**: Defines roles and permissions for users.

#### Application Entities
- **Application**: Represents an application within the system.
- **ApplicationSetting**: Stores settings specific to an application.
- **ApplicationConfig**: Stores configuration details of an application.
- **ApplicationLog**: Logs activities related to an application.

#### Module Entities
- **Module**: Represents a module within an application.
- **ModuleSetting**: Stores settings specific to a module.
- **ModuleLog**: Logs activities related to a module.

### Database Integration
- **PostgreSQL**: Used for storing relational data, including user information, application settings, and module details.
- **Redis**: Used for caching frequently accessed data.
- **InfluxDB**: Used for storing time-series data, such as logs and weather data.

The enhanced ER diagram visually represents the relationships between these entities and their respective databases.
