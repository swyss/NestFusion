# 1. Use Cases
Back [to README](readme.md)
## 1.1 Requirement Specification
Detailed description of the functional and non-functional requirements of the system.

## 1.2 Use Case Diagrams
Visualization of the interactions between users and the system. These diagrams illustrate the various ways users can interact with the system and the relationships between user actions and system responses.

# 2. System Design

## 2.1 Architecture Diagrams
Description of the system's high-level architecture, including the main components and their interactions. These diagrams should clarify the distributed nature of the system, if applicable, and the communication between system components.

## 2.2 Sequence Diagrams
Illustration of the interactions between components for key processes. These diagrams help understand the sequence of operations and how components work together at runtime.

## 2.3 Class Diagrams
Structure of the system in terms of classes, their attributes, operations, and the relationships between classes. Class diagrams provide detailed insight into the software design.

# 3. Data Modeling

## 3.1 Entity-Relationship Diagrams (ERD)
Representation of the data structure and relationships between entities in the system. ERDs are crucial for understanding data persistence and the relational structure of the database.

## 3.2 Data Flow Diagrams (DFD)
Visualization of the flow of data through the system. DFDs show how data moves between processes, data stores, and external entities.

# 4. User Interface and Experience

## 4.1 Mockups and Wireframes
Designs of the user interface and user experience. Mockups and wireframes are essential for visualizing the user interfaces and interaction flows within the application.
